        programs ("The Night Show", "The Saturday Show", "The 
        Candidate" and others) from American analogues (eg 
        "Friends").In the summer of 2007, the staff of the Night 
        Show Studio went to America, met with the producers and 
        screenwriters of popular sitcoms, attended the recording 
        process. In addition, he trained at Warner Brothers Studios 
        and earned the right to do this format. The show's style and 
        humor became the reason for its mass popularity. The first 
        series of the series aired on September 23, 2007. The series 
        was aired every Saturday and Sunday at 10 pm on Hope channel.
